# 1. Array
The most basic yet important data structure is the array. It is a linear data structure. 
An array is a collection of homogeneous data types where the elements are allocated contiguous memory. 
Because of the contiguous allocation of memory, any element of an array can be accessed in constant time. 
Each array element has a corresponding index number.
