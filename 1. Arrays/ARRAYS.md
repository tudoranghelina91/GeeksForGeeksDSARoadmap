# 1. Array
The most basic yet important data structure is the array. It is a linear data structure. 
An array is a collection of homogeneous data types where the elements are allocated contiguous memory. 
Because of the contiguous allocation of memory, any element of an array can be accessed in constant time. 
Each array element has a corresponding index number.

Array Data Structure

To learn more about arrays, refer to the article “Introduction to Arrays“.

Here are some topics about array which you must learn:

Rotation of Array – Rotation of array means shifting the elements of an array in a circular manner i.e., in the case of right circular shift the last element becomes the first element, and all other element moves one point to the right. 
Rearranging an array – Rearrangement of array elements suggests the changing of an initial order of elements following some conditions or operations.
Range queries in the array – Often you need to perform operations on a range of elements. These functions are known as range queries.
Multidimensional array – These are arrays having more than one dimension. The most used one is the 2-dimensional array, commonly known as a matrix.
